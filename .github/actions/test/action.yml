    description: Replay.io API Key
    # This API key allows access to the whole team that holds all these test
    # recordings. If someone wanted to, they could go in and delete the workspace
    # or recordings in it or anything. While thats not great, it's also not
    # the end of the world. If someone does that, we can always change
    # this code to only run in CI in the main repo and have this as a secret.
    # It's a lot easier to hardcode it for now though.
