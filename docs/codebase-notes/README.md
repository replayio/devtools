# Codebase Structure Running Notes

I'm taking some general notes on the structure of the codebase as it currently exists (2022-03) and adding them here for reference.

These may very quickly get outdated depending on how we continue doing cleaning up and refactoring, but hopefully this can both help with the refactoring process and serve as a guide to what's going on inside the codebase atm.
