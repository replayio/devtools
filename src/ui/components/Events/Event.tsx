/*
Jump to the function location that ran for a given info sidebar event list item,
such as "Click" or "Key Press: L"

This requires stringing together a series of assumptions and special cases:

- The info sidebar "Click" events come from `Session.findMouseEvents`, and keyboard events
  from `Session.findKeyboardEvents`
  These events are recorded in our browser forks _before_ any actual JS code runs.
- However, we can assume that a _real_ "user interaction event" such as 
  `"click"` or `"keypress"` event occurs shortly thereafter.
- We can find that event based on a timeboxed search, with the initial sidebar event time
  as the starting point.
- We can use the interaction event's stack frame to know the location of the JS event handler
  that started running in response to the event. _However_, React attaches noop handlers,
  and implements its own event listener lookups at the top level (delegation).
- Fortunately, React 16/17/18 add a secret expando property to DOM nodes, containing 
  the actual props that the user rendered for that DOM node, such as `onClick`.
- All interaction events will have a JS event object such as `MouseEvent`or `InputEvent`
   as one of their arguments
- Once we find the event object, we can look at `event.target` to find the clicked node
- But, the _target_ may not have had the handler due to delegation - the user-provided
  React handler prop may have been on an ancestor DOM node instead.
- So, we can walk up the parent node chain and find the first node that has a React
  handler prop with a relevant name attached to it, if any, and return that
- In order to optimize the API calls and network traffic, that parent node traversal
  is done via a single JS evaluation, which returns `{target, handlerProp?}`.
- If we found a React event handler prop in the chain, jump to that location. Otherwise,
  jump to the location of the plain JS event handler in the stack frame.

We _could_ do more analysis and find the nearest time where the first breakable location
inside that function is running, then seek to that point in time, but skipping for now.
